Notes:
- On most repo hosting websites, if there is a "README.md" file in the root folder of a code repository, the website will display whatever is in it on the "landing page" for that repository.
- So, for example, when I push this empty repository up to Github.com, Github will show the contents of this file if I go view the "TestCSharp" repo.
- Github will also have tabs for viewing any code in the repo, viewing pull requests (requests to merge new code into the main line of development)
